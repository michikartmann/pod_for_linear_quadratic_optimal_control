# POD for Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control

This repository contains the code implemented during the exercises of the course "POD for Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control" by Prof. Dr. Stefan Volkwein at the University Konstanz during the summer term 2024.
A parabolic linear-quadratic optimal control problem is solved using POD model order reduction and a Barzilai-Borwein Gradient method. The error is quantitified using a posteriori error estimates. The discretization of the PDEs is done with FeniCS 2019.
